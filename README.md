### Notes
Some challenges I faced while building the app:
- I forgot to rename the view controllers after creating them so identifying them would be hard.
- For some labels I created, I forgot to create the corresponding outlet for it.
- Getting the API endpoint that I wanted for my "favorites" tab view required some research into the movie database API documentation.
- Working with WebView was very new to me, so I consulted a lot of the Apple Developer documentation and played around with loading basic pages first, then delved into getting the required endpoint to load the youtube trailer.
- When I first created the grid view, I ran into a problem where my poster images were very small, and it turns out that was an easy fix when I changed "Estimate Size" to None.
- Messing around with auto layout was a challenge for me, but after reading a few documents and watching a few videos, it finally made sense.

### Things to improve on:
- To view the youtube trailer, a user had to click on the poster only for the table view. If a user clicked on a poster in the details page from a grid view, nothing would pop up. Implementing that would make the app more uniform.

### How to run the application: 
- I used Cocoapods to set the images using the AlamofireImage library. Thus, when you download the files, you will have to run the app by clicking on "flixster.xcworkspace".
